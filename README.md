Western Branch Academy
======================

Homepage and App created for Western Branch Academy
---------------------------------------------------

This app was developed for a local school in my area. I used Ionic to make a hybrid app built around Angular so that the client's homepage would be updated and they would have a site that worked natively on mobile.

By using Ionic I learned how to adapt this project to different platforms; web, ios, and android.

*To Do*
- *add backend support to make it a fullstack app*
- *open pdf files in system viewer*
- *open url's in system browser*
- *migrate to Angular 2 and Ionic 2*
